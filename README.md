    DoubleST - 16MHz bus accelerator and new video modes for Atari 1040ST

    See https://blog.troed.se/projects/atari-st-new-video-modes/ for more
    information. This code is used for the updated version with a GAL
    controlling the clocks instead of a binary counter.

    Pin assignment is preconfigured for GAL20V8, but the implementation
    is compatible with GAL16V8 as well.
